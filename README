Disclaimer
The author is not bound in any way to phone carrier companies (from now, the “Carriers”) supported by the Software. By using the Software you agree to use the service in conformity with the terms of service (“ToS”) of your Carrier. Any use of the Software in violation of the ToS, aimed at sending unsolicited messages (SPAM) or in violation of existing laws is strictly forbidden.

The author is not responsible for the use of the Software by its users. By using the Software, the user accepts to EXPLICITLY DISCHARGE the author from ANY RESPONSIBILITY arisen from the use of the Software. In particular, the author won’t be considered responsible for unsolicited, obscene, diffamatory messages sent by users of the Software.

The Software plays a role of broker between the user and the Carrier’s web SMS service. The user acknowledges that, in order to achieve this function, the Software must know the credentials to access the service (username and password, from now, the “Credentials”) and the relevant parameters of the SMS message (recipient number, text of the message, from now, the “Parameters”). The Software uses the Credentials of the user exclusively in order to access the Carrier’s service and perform the sending of the messages. Credentials and Parameters will never be shared with the author or any third party. For the convenience of the user, Credentials are stored on her computer in order to be readily available for subsequent uses of the Software. Sent messages are saved in the folder ~/Library/SMS.

The Software can not be used for any reason to make emergency calls.
